# TODO

This is an un-curated list of things that should be done.
Feel free to add points, please add a TAG to indicate how hard it is + how urgent it is.

## General organisation

* This package will draw from everywhere so probably good to have a decent way of listing packages that this package relies on + how to deal with the license.

## Generalized Linear Regression

### Ridge

* (**low priority, easy**) Allow for element-wise penalty, will change to `X'X+Diagonal(Î»)`
* (**low priority, easy**) Clean up conditions, see [in OnlineStats](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl/blob/master/src/stats/linregbuilder.jl) what they're doing (posdef check + symmetric)

### Lasso

* (**high priority, medium**) Implement a FISTA backend (either that or look up what they do in SparseRegression and copy that)
